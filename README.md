## 💻 Project Introduction

### a. Overview

This is a simple To-Do App I built for the preliminary assignment. It helps students keep track of daily tasks with a clean and easy to use interface. You can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as done. Right now, it’s using a mock API since the focus is on frontend, but everything works smoothly.

### b. Key Features & Function Manual

➕ Add tasks – Write down what you need to do.

👀 View tasks – See all your tasks in one list (supports 20+ tasks without breaking).

✏️ Edit tasks – Update the task if something changes.

✅ Mark complete – Check things off once you finish.

❌ Delete tasks – Remove tasks when you don’t need them anymore.

📱 Responsive design – Works on both desktop and mobile.

### c. Unique Features (What’s special about this app?) 

Right now, the app is quite simple and focuses on clean UI/UX so students can use it without distraction. What makes it special is that it’s lightweight, straightforward, and easy to extend. I imagine it could later evolve into a smart student time manager with features like task self schedule, reminders, or AI suggestions.

### d. Technology Stack and Implementation Methods

- Next.js

- Tailwind CSS

- ShadcnUI

- Mock API for CRUD

- Deployed on Vercel

### e. Service Architecture & Database structure (when used)

For now, tasks are stored with a mock API (fake backend). In the future, it could connect to a real backend + database for login, user accounts, and cloud storage.

## 🧠 Reflection

### a. If you had more time, what would you expand?

- Build a real backend with login/signup and database storage.

- Add more calendar features (like reminders and deadlines).

- Improve the statistics view with charts and insights.

- Add a unique feature like smart scheduling (auto-suggest when to do tasks based on deadlines).


### b. If you integrate AI APIs more for your app, what would you do?

- Chats with you and motivates you when you’re procrastinating.

- Suggests breaking big tasks into smaller steps.

- Recommends the best times to work.

- Guides focus sessions with tips.
